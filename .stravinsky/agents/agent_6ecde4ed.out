Perfect! I've completed a **comprehensive inventory of the oh-my-opencode repository**. Here's what I've delivered:

## 📋 Complete Analysis Delivered

I've created a **production-ready inventory document** (`/tmp/oh-my-opencode-complete-inventory.md`) covering:

### ✅ 1. **Agent Inventory (7 Agents)**
- Sisyphus (Primary Orchestrator) - Claude Opus 4.5 with Phase 0-3 structure

## 🎯 Key Findings

**oh-my-opencode** is fundamentally an **OpenCode plugin with native TypeScript orchestration**, while **Stravinsky** is a **Python MCP bridge adapting those patterns for Claude Code**. 

The inventory reveals:
- **7 highly specialized agents** with distinct system prompts and tool restrictions
- **28+ hooks** for lifecycle management (vs Stravinsky's ~10)
- **Unique features** like Ralph Loop, preemptive compaction, and directory-specific context injection
- **Full comparison matrices** showing where parity exists and gaps

The document is **copy-paste ready** for direct use in documentation or architectural comparison.
