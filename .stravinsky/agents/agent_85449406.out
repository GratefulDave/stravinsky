I'm ready to help with documentation and research! However, I notice your message ends with "Task 2..." without specifying what you'd like me to research or document.

Could you please provide the complete task? For example:
- What technology, library, or concept should I research?
- What specific implementation examples are you looking for?
- What documentation do you need me to find or summarize?

Once you provide the details, I'll:
1. Gather relevant information using available tools (web search, code search, etc.)
2. Process and analyze it using Gemini Flash
3. Return comprehensive documentation and examples

What would you like me to research?
